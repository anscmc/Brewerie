Hello _______,

Matt told me you were interested in a new website for The Brewerie, so I built a prototype of what I think helps better represent your brewpub.
Here's the link to a demo (and some notes below):
Homepage: I think a similar picture, but one taken when the room is mostly filled with people would look great.
I think it would be really cool to have our photographer get individual pictures of your bottled beer so we can show them on the home page,
as well as the "Beers" page. It would also be a good idea to have curtis take new pictures for the site because a great website relies on great pictures,
especially those representing the food and beverage industry. If you're interested, let me know! We can have your website up in no time.

Thanks,
Andrew

email to lavery with same link saying we could do something similar (or completetly different), either way I know we can make you a great
looking site that helps best represent your company
